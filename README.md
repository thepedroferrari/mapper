# The Mapper Challenge
This challenge targets frontend engineers and is about showing basic knowledge of React, Redux and API integrations.

Even though it has been made with the intention to show-case basic frontend knowledge, the task could be extended with requiring an implementation of the whole or parts of the backend as well - given an API description. 

There is a skeleton app to get the person started, as well as a small web service to integrate with.

The challenge description can be found in [challenge.md](challenge.md).

## Evaluation
When evaluating, typical things to consider are:
* react
	* scope of the components
* redux
	* shape of the state
	* how actions are composed
	* reducers; many small vs few big
	* acting on actions; beautiful sagas or nested thunks; sync or async?
* other
	* testability
	* if the codebase can evolve smoothly
